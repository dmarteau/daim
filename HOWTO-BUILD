Build Requirements :
====================

 * MacOSX 10.4+
 * Linux
 * Windows 2000SP4/XP/Vista with Cygwin or MSYS environment 

MSYS environment with mozilla build:
http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/mozilla/libraries/win32/MozillaBuildSetup-1.4.exe


Notes for all platforms:
========================

The build process use standard 'make' makefiles.
The build process can be easily driven using the setup script located at

http://3liz.org/svn/daim/trunk/daim2/daim-setup.sh

Checkout the file and follow command line instructions


Compiling DAIM on Linux:
===========================

You will need GCC v4.0 or higher.

Python 2.5 or higher.

Compiling DAIM on mac OSX:
===========================

Use gcc provided with the latest version of xcode.

Python 2.5 or higher.


Compiling DAIM on Windows:
===========================

You will need:

Visual 8 or higher (DAIM WILL NOT compile on previous version of visual C++)

Gnu make (available for windows with the Cygwin distribution http://www.cygwin.com or MSYS/MinGW configuration)

A sh compatible shell (available for windows with the Cygwin distribution http://www.cygwin.com or
the MSYS environment)

A Python v2.5+ distribution for compiling idl files to c++ header files, 

NOTE: The mozilla build system (based on MSYS) provide all the necessary requirements for building DAIM (including svn).
It can be downloaded at:

http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/mozilla/libraries/win32/ 

(Use version 1.3 minimum; as previous versions has not been tested)

While the stl provided with Visual should be ok I recommand using STLPort v5+ (VC8 compatible) .
STLPort is available at http://www.stlport.com

Note: The daim library do not use STL strings nor io streams, it means that you should 
not have any link dependencies with the stlport runtime, use only headers. 

Note: this is not the case with dependant libs as GDAL that use C++ stream, but GDAL is compiled
independantly from the rest of the DAIM code base. 
 
 
Building width minimal gdal drivers
====================================

The default I/O drivers use a static build of GDAL as back-end image loader.

Building width a pre-installed gdal distribution
======================================

By default, daim use a custom build of gdal
If you want use a preinstalled gdal distribution define GDAL_HOME to point to your 
installed files

Set DM_GDAL_DLL=0  f you plan to link statically (the default) to the GDAL code. 

Gdal driver will be dynamically linked with the pre-installed gdal distribution
